## survival anaylsis 
This project involves a survival analysis on the melanoma dataset available in R-studio using the non parametic model (Kaplan-mier model)
and semi-parametric model (cox proportional hazard),hypothesis testing was also done on the assumptions made on the model.

#### BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DATASET
Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that develops when melanocytes (the cells that give the skin its tan
or brown colour) start to grow out of control. Cancer starts when cells in the body begin to grow out of
control. Cells in nearly any part of the body can become cancer, and can then spread to other areas of the
body. After surgery for the removal of the tumour, some patients survive and some do not. It is important to
understand the factors that contribute to the death after surgery, so that adequate measures can be taken to
protect patients' lives and increase their chances of survival.
The data set used for this analysis consists of measurements made on patients with malignant melanoma.
Each patient had their tumour removed by surgery at the Department of Plastic Surgery, University Hospital of
Odense, Denmark during the period 1962 to 1977. The surgery consisted of complete removal of the tumour
together with about 2.5cm of the surrounding skin. Among the measurements taken were the thickness of the
tumour and whether it was ulcerated or not. These are thought to be important prognostic variables in that
patients with a thick and/or ulcerated tumour have an increased chance of death from melanoma. Patients
were followed until the end of 1977
